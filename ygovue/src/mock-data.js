    description: "The Tri-Brigade engine generally prefers to go first, which means that Cyber Dragons really benefit off of going second. The sheer consistency of the deck must be respected, especially since most Cyber Dragon variants can't afford to run many hand-traps (if any). Despite this fact, Cyber Dragon actually has a really strong matchup with Tri-Brigade Zoodiac. The best of one format combined with how powerful Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon is versus Tri-Brigade's common turn one boards makes it very easy to steal games from them. Bird-Up Tri-Brigade is a different story, however, and is much more difficult to defeat than pure Tri-Brigade or Tri-Brigade Zoodiac."
